Particularly for me, I was working part-time at a supermarket from 04:00 - 08:00, then taking the train to university and starting the lectures at 09:00 until 13:00, followed by a 1 hour break, then our Networking lesson from 14:00 to 18:00.\nBeing awake very early for my job, I was literally dozing off during the lesson \u0026ndash; not a good look. The fact that our lecturer was literally reading off PowerPoint slides, each packed with lots of information didn\u0026rsquo;t help much, lots of students were missing from the classroom too, choosing to skip the lessons altogether. Well, not me! Even though I was super tired, I was still doing my best to try and understand. After passing the exams and module, we never had to deal with Networking again in the following years.\nTrying to get into cybersecurity # I\u0026rsquo;ve watched several roadmaps on how to get into the cybersecurity field as a beginner, and several people (YouTube) have recommended to get the Cisco CCNA certification. I am aware that it is intermediate level and quite difficult, but not impossible. There is also CompTIA Network+ and it is not as though as CCNA, but if I\u0026rsquo;m planning on achieving the latter, might as well save myself some money in the process, plus lots of vendors use Cisco equipment.\nJust when I thought that I would be done with Networking and never have to study again, I regretted not liking the lectures from university.\nStudying for CCNA # I have researched several resources on studying for the exam, one that caught my interest being Jeremy\u0026rsquo;s IT Lab CCNA Course on YouTube. It is completely free, the lecturer (Jeremy McDowell) explains things very well and organises the lectures in a way that combines both theory and practice (Packet Tracer labs and Anki flashcards).\nCurrently I am about halfway through the course and I\u0026rsquo;m not going to lie, it is quite challenging (looking at you Spanning Tree Protocol), however with enough revision and practice labs it becomes a bit clearer.\nAfter finishing the course I plan to do practice exams using Boson ExSim-Max, carefully going through each question, analysing all the wrong and correct answers, finding my weakest areas and going back to the course videos where needed.\nMy aim is to take the official exam sometime September ~ October 2025.\n","date":"25 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/studying-ccna/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003ch2 class=\"relative group\"\u003eIntroduction \n    \u003cdiv id=\"introduction\" class=\"anchor\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \u003cspan\n        class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 ltr:-left-6 rtl:-right-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100\"\u003e\n        \u003ca class=\"group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700 !no-underline\" href=\"#introduction\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003c/span\u003e        \n    \n\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my goal to become a cybersecurity practitioner, I acknowledged that it is essential to have an understanding of \u003cstrong\u003enetworking\u003c/strong\u003e, as majority of hacks and breaches happen on that layer.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Studying for Cisco CCNA","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"25 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"23 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/german/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"German","type":"categories"},{"content":" Introduction # Since being a teenager, I never really had any interaction with the German language. Our school curriculum only included English and French as foreign languages \u0026ndash; not really liking the latter, I always thought to myself I would never go live in France, so I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t need it.\nAt one point some of my closest family members have moved to Germany, got in their car and drove for a couple days from Romania. When they got there, they didn\u0026rsquo;t know one bit of the language.\nVisiting family # Eventually after a couple years my family members have integrated in Germany and have learned how to read and speak to an acceptable level. I\u0026rsquo;ve visited them during one summer and I was able to sign up for lectures in their local secondary school.\nI was attending Deutschkurs (German course), which comprised of multiple students that were there way before I signed up. We were given reading, speaking and listening practice nearly everyday and were tasked to complete homework. I was supplementing my knowledge of the language with software like Rossetta Stone. I was also attending regular German lectures even though I didn\u0026rsquo;t fully understand what was going on, although it was a fun time, I made great friends and memories.\nGoing back to England # Although I\u0026rsquo;ve spent only about 3 months with my family, all the while attending German courses, I had to return to England as I was about to start college. It felt quite rewarding learning something new and realising the feeling of progress that you get. Our teacher was particularly proud of me as I was learning at a very rapid pace, compared to her other students that she\u0026rsquo;s been teaching for longer.\nDeciding to learn German again # As I was back in England, I found it difficult to find the motivation to pick up studying German again, because I didn\u0026rsquo;t need to use it. I still visited family quite often and been able to hold small conversations with native people, although quite difficult. In my goal to become a cybersecurity practitioner, I would one day like to explore and work in Zurich, Switzerland in particular. It is part of the German speaking canton, and if I would like to visit family I could simply do a 5 hour drive to them, or just take a plane.\nFinal goal and steps to do # Take the exam and achieve B2 level in German. When I achieve that I will feel confident in my skills to be able to work in a German speaking environment. It won\u0026rsquo;t be a short journey, estimating roughly 1-2 years of being self-taught and being committed.\nSeveral resources that I will make use of include:\nCoffee Break German | YouTube Channel Reading books and listening to their audiobook Watching movies/TV shows in German Putting my devices in German Using Anki flashcards on a regular basis By surrounding myself with an appropriate environment, I believe this would be a great way of learning passively + actively.\n","date":"23 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/learning-german/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003ch2 class=\"relative group\"\u003eIntroduction \n    \u003cdiv id=\"introduction\" class=\"anchor\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \u003cspan\n        class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 ltr:-left-6 rtl:-right-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100\"\u003e\n        \u003ca class=\"group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700 !no-underline\" href=\"#introduction\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003c/span\u003e        \n    \n\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince being a teenager, I never really had any interaction with the German language.

After moving to England as a teenager, I studied Computer Science at Milton Keynes College and completed a BSc (Hons) in Software Engineering (2:1) at the University of Northampton.\nI work extensively with both Fedora Linux and Windows in a dual-boot environment, and I\u0026rsquo;m also familiar with macOS and iOS devices. Over the years, I’ve developed strong technical skills by diagnosing, repairing hardware and software issues, upgrading components (RAM, SSDs, GPUs, CPUs), and building custom desktop computers for friends and family.\nIn March 2025, I achieved my CompTIA Security+ certification.
